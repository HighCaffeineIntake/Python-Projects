This Folder will contain my Python scripts that I wrote during my masters thesis.

json2pythonlibrary is a simple python script that takes .json files from the BGSU RNA Motif Atlas and extracts the Loop IDs, the sequence and the base positions within their respective RNA when given a Motif ID. This will be important for making the .hh files necessary for RNA Motif detection.
